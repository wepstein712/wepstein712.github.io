					<p class="large_text"> I've been running D&D games for over 6 years, just finishing a three year long game, and I'm looking at expanding into new systems like Star Wars and Mouse Guard. I'm a senior ChemE about to graduate. I joined NUTRS looking to join a game, but I left with friends that will last me beyond college, phenomenal memories, and growth as a person. I want NUTRS to be the same home for you that it has been for me through its events, its goals, and its people. If you have any questions about D&D or the club or ChemE or anything at all, I'm always happy to help! </p>

Please. Help me stop. I’m so cold. I am primarily responsible for wrangling our Committee of Game Organization, which is a fancy way of saying I don’t do anything. I love to talk about birds, warlocks, and any combination of the two. I can also give tips about cold weather survival, if that’s your thing.</p>
